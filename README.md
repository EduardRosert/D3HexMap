## D3HexMap - Tesselating the World with Hexagon Tiles
This repo is a companion demo for
the article on *Interactive Hex World Map using D3*
<http://bennycheung.github.io/interactive-hex-world-map-using-d3>

We wonder if marrying a hexagonal tile system
with the traditional geographic system (longitude/latitude)
will provide a better reasoning and visual perception.

## How to Run

Go into D3HexMap directory,

* for python 2.x

```
python -m SimpleHttpServer
```

* for python 3.x

```
python3 -m http.server
```

or use any Http server to serve this site.

Navigate from the browser to http://localhost:8000 (default port is 8000)
to see the main page `index.html`.

Then you should see the following,
